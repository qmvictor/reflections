How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   You can see the bug comparing a file that is working with one with an error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Less time looking for the bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually:
    Pro: You choose if what you are doing is working for you and save it or not.
    Con: If you forgot to save, you lose what you've done

 Automatically:
  	Pro: Your work is always safe.
  	Con: It saves everytime you make a change and sometimes theres somethign you don't   

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git lets you choose what is important to save or not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see the commit history and git diff to see the difference between the commits you want.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always get back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
 
An App I'm working on in Ruby.
